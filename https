1. Identify, install, and enable modules required for the apache service to use HTTPS. Document how this was done.
In order to identify install and enable the modules required for apache server to use HTTPS. I looked up what module would be required
According to an Ubuntu website, the module we need to install is mod-ssl, to install this we use sudo a2enmod ssl which enables the ssl module, then we will want to 
configure the HTTPS module using sudo a2enmod default-ssl. then restart apache using sudo systemctl restart apache2

2. Firewall acknowledgments to allow access to server over configured port

using the commands sudo ufw allow 443 will turn on traffic flow to the HTTPS port allowing for HTTPS access, through the Apache server
