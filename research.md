1. Identify a site that will confirm whether or not a domain is available
   While researching and finding websites that will find domain websites that will determine wheter or not a domain is available or not, there are many sites that offer the possibility of being used for a domain search

   2. Recommend two different domain names to purchase / lease. Defend your choices and which the business should buy
